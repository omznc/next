# omznc/next

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project template that I've been using for my projects.

I decided to turn it into an actual template so that I can use it for future projects, and also so that others can use it as well. 

### Usage

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/omznc/next
```
