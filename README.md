### This is a Bun-based [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project template that I've been using for my projects.

I decided to turn it into an actual template so that I can use it for future projects, and also so that others can use it as well. 

### Usage

```bash
bunx create-next-app -e https://github.com/omznc/next
```

### Features

- Bun Support
- App Router & Server Actions
- Authentication (Auth.js) 🗝️ 
- Database (Prisma) 📄
- Storage (Backblaze or S3 compatible) 📦
- Pre-commit hooks (Husky) 🤖
- Formatting (Prettier) 🌅
- State management (Zustand) 🐻
- Icons (react-icons) 💖
- Environment variables (t3-env) 🥸
